1.Many people face long nights at work. Truck drivers, security guards, healthcare professionals. Jobs that are fundamental to society and to the health, wellbeing and comfort of the general population. As a result, getting behind the wheel while feeling tired is not uncommon. It’s something most drivers have probably done. It can be incredibly dangerous, unless we find a way to warn drivers when their tiredness has become too severe and is impairing their driving.


2.Drowsiness detection works to prevent accidents created by microsleep, fatigue and lack of attention. Driver drowsiness detection systems generally come as one tool, one part of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). These are various programs and technologies designed to make driving safer and lessen the chances of human error resulting in catastrophic road traffic incidents. These can range from warning drivers if there’s something in their blind spot, to automatic emergency braking.


3.The phrase ‘driver drowsiness detection’ is the general term for systems that monitor driver attention. Mercedes-Benz calls it ‘Attention Assist’, Land Rover calls its system ‘Driver Condition Monitor’. Volvo’s system, called ‘Driver Alert’, has been shown to be successful, with a 97% success rate at determining a driver’s drowsiness. There are other independent devices that the driver can place in their vehicle themselves, which help to reduce the risks associated with loss of concentration while driving. The ‘Anti-Sleep Pilot’ is a device that continuously calculates a driver’s fatigue levels using 17 different parameters, with the device resting on dashboard.


4.The step in the detection procedure is to detect drowsiness. The images are passed to the image processing module, which performs face landmark detection to detect the distraction and drowsiness of the driver. The system uses the landmarks of the eyes and face to detect drowsiness and alerts the driver to take a break when drowsiness is detected.
